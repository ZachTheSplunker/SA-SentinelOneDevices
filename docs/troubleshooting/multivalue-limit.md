# Update category multivalue limit

By default, Splunk Enterprise Security limits the values for the category field to 25. This add-on has around 30 values for the category field, which will shorten to 25 unless the default is updated.

To increase the default limit, perform the following:

1. From Enterprise Security, navigate to Configure > Data Enrichment > Asset and Identity Management.
1. On the middle navigation, select "Asset Fields."
1. Click the category field from the table and increase the "Multivalue Limit" to __40__.
